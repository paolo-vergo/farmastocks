# Pharmastocks: GARCH Modelling of Pharmaceutical Stocks using MATLAB

![Pharmastocks Banner](https://www.sarem-seitz.com/content/images/2023/01/gdaxi.png)

## Description

Welcome to Pharmastocks, a sophisticated project that leverages GARCH modeling techniques to analyze and forecast the logarithmic daily increase in closing prices of leading pharmaceutical stocks. In this project, we focus on the stocks of four prominent companies: Astrazeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, and Pfizer, for a yearly period ending on April 25th, 2021.

Our comprehensive approach incorporates a range of advanced methodologies and statistical tests, including:

- Augmented Dickey Fuller test
- ARMA modeling
- Model selection using AIC and BIC
- One-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov non-parametric test for normality
- Ljung-Box Q-test
- GARCH modeling
- EGARCH modeling
- Comparison of forecasting performances using MAE and MSE metrics
